I am the designer of Vivado_HLS C-RTL cosimulation system. Today I just run a simple example by using HLS to generate a sigmoid design.
Exponential function is using Taylor series.

C design is under c_design
One python program under python_test is used to test the c design sigmoid function is correct. Because python can use the exp function provided by numpy.
As C sim need to compare double type data with golden result, the golden result must be a range, not an exactly double data.

RTL generated by HLS is under HLS_result/verilog

What my cosim system generated are under simulation_related. Including c++ wrapper files and autotb.v file. 
These testbench files generated refering to tmp files under tmp_file (rtl_wrap.cfg.tcl and tbgen.tcl), which are stored under .autopilot/db.
This folder is hide from user. 

Cosim flow: 
1) wrapc run original c design and get input data.
2) Input data stored under tv/cdatafile
3) Run RTL simulation under verilog using my autotb.v, generate RTL output data to tv/rtldatafile
4) wrapc_pc run original c design again and read tv/rtldatafile data and compare with c design's golden data.


Two secrets can prove I am the cosim system designer:
1) Vivado_hls used to be call autopilot, before AutoESL been acquired by Xilinx.
2) We use one cpp wrapper file in both wrapc and wrapc_pc section. One hidden file ".hls_cosim_wrapc_switch.log" in solution1/sim/wrapc_pc to differ if this section is wrapc or wrapc_pc.
